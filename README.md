# Agent Skills

A collection of AI agent skills designed for [Agent Zero](https://github.com/frdel/agent-zero) and compatible AI systems such as Claude Code. Each skill is a self-contained module with its own script(s) and documentation.

Contributions are welcome! If you have an idea for a new skill or an improvement to an existing one, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

| [venice-video-generate](./venice-skills/venice-video-generate/) | Full-lifecycle video generation (queue + poll + retrieve + save) |
| [venice-video-queue](./venice-skills/venice-video-queue/) | Queue a video for generation (text/image/video-to-video) |
| [venice-video-quote](./venice-skills/venice-video-quote/) | Get cost estimates for video generation with parameter validation |
| [venice-video-retrieve](./venice-skills/venice-video-retrieve/) | Retrieve and download a queued video by polling until complete |

## Structure

Each skill follows a consistent layout:

```
skill-name/
  SKILL.md          # Agent-facing documentation (frontmatter + usage)
  README.md         # Human-facing GitHub documentation
  scripts/          # Executable scripts
  config/           # Configuration files (if applicable)
```

- **`SKILL.md`** -- Contains frontmatter metadata (name, description, tags, trigger patterns) used by Agent Zero's skill system, plus detailed usage instructions for the agent.
- **`README.md`** -- Human-readable documentation for GitHub visitors.
- **`scripts/`** -- The actual executable code for the skill.

## Requirements

Skills have varying dependencies. Common requirements:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **API Keys** -- Each skill documents its required environment variables. Never hardcode API keys; always use environment variables.

| Skill | Required Env Vars |
|-------|-------------------|
| browser-use-cloud | `BROWSER_USE_API_KEY` |
| deep-research | *(none -- uses DuckDuckGo)* |
| search-google-places | `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`, `VENICE_API_KEY` (optional, for review synthesis) |
| seats-award-search-by-date | `SEATS_AERO_API_KEY`, `VENICE_API_KEY` (optional, for infographic) |
| use-opencode | `VENICE_API_KEY` |
